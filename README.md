The codeklavier development adventure has just begun (March-April 2017). This is a 'hello world' and more information will be added soon.

## INSTALL and HowTO

1. install npm and node.js
2. install robotjs (``npm install`` and afterwards you might need to move ``robotjs.node`` from the Release to the node_modules directory)
3. connect your midi keyboard and a good set of speakers
4. boot suppercollider
5. run ``node codeK.js`` (or equivalent js-file, depending on your branch and goal)
6. Start playing

### Tips & tricks

You might want to use *Atom* and use a git plugin and a supercollider plugin.

* Currently refactoring everything into Python3! :D (<a href='https://github.com/narcode/codeklavier-python'>https://github.com/narcode/codeklavier-python</a>)
